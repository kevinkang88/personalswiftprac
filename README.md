## Chapter 1

### 1st iteration

* Playground
* var
* let
* comments
* comeback: integer division
* comeback: fire up Playground
* print()
* ptintln()
* how to show console output in Playground
* see what is wrong with this
```swift
var x = 1
var y = 2
var sum = x  + y

var x = 3
var y = 4
var sum = x + y
```
* find values for a and b
```swift
let sum = 16 // a + b  
let diff = 4 // a - b
```
~~always breakdown problem into smaller tasks and use variables to store found values along the way~~
~~if there is a purpose for the variable other than simple number, make the variable name more meaningful~~
~~try plugging in numbers if you get stuck~~
* comeback: last digit
* comeback: brothers (redo eventho I killed it)
* comeback: Apples and Oranges
* comeback: Boys and Girls
